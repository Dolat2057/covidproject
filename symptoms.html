            <h1>What is Covid-19?</h1>
           
            
             <p>It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has transferred to humans from animals. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.
            </p>
            <h1>Symptoms</h1>
               <p> 
                Reported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death for confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.

                These symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure (based on the incubation period of MERS-CoV viruses).
                People may be sick with the virus for 1 to 14 days before developing symptoms. The most common symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.
                More rarely, the disease can be serious and even fatal. Older people, and people with other medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease), may be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill.
<p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment.

  About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.
  
  <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
  <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>
 <li> a new continuous cough - this means you’ve started coughing repeatedly</li>
</ul>
 <p> As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>
  
  <strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a temperature or a cough?</strong>
  No. In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should<strong> stay at home for at least 7 days.</strong> If you live with other people, they should <strong>stay at home for at least 14 days,</strong> to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.
  
  In the UK, you should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.
  
  Many countries have imposed travel bans and lockdown conditions in order to try and halt the spread of the virus.<strong> You should check with your local authorities for the latest advice on seeking medical assistance.</strong></p>
